Today, the world economy is experiencing unprecedented change. India stands as the world's fifth-largest economic power, with Indian entrepreneurs emerging as global leaders. India's knowledge has made it a preferred destination for outsourcing services and a hub for world-class R&D centers and innovation hubs. New developments in science and technology, media revolutions, internationalization of education, and the ever-expanding competitive environment are revolutionizing the education scene.

SRISTI plays a vital role in developing these qualities, nurturing talents, and acting as a launchpad for innovative ideas and emerging leaders in the technical domain. I welcome everyone who wants to be a part of this mission and join hands as we shape the world of tomorrow.
